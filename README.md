# How to connect a bot to Telegram
1. Get a token for your bot
Open the Telegram app.

Find the BotFather bot (type @BotFather in the Telegram search box).

Send the '/start' command to start the interaction.

Create a new bot using the command '/newbot.'

Enter a name for the bot (e.g. PumpTraderBot).

Enter a unique username for the bot ending in bot (e.g. PumpTrader_PumpBot).

BotFather will generate an API token (for example: 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11).

Save this token, you will need it for customization.

2. Configure the token in your code
Open the 'config.json' file in your bot's code directory.

Make sure it contains the following format:

'{ "telegram_token": "YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_BOTFATHER", "solana_rpc_url": "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com" }'

Replace 'YOUR_TOKEN_FROM_BOTFATHER' with the token provided by BotFather.

If you have your own RPC URL for Solana, replace https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com.

3. Start the bot
Make sure you have Python version 3.8 or higher installed.

Install the necessary libraries:

'pip install py-solana pyTelegramBotAPI'

Run the script:
'python your_bot_file.py'

Make sure that 'your_bot_file.py' replaced by the name of the bot code file.
4. Check the bot's performance
In Telegram, search for your bot by username (e.g. @PumpTrader_PumpBot).

Send the command '/start'

Check the available commands with '/help'.
